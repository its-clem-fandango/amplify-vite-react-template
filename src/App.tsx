  /* Notes: {id} === id: id, name of variable and key in object are the same so we can use 
  shorthand here. The delete method in this context expects to receive an object as its argument. This object
  is typically used to specify which item or items you want to delete from the database.
  Since a "Todo" item is identified by its id, you pass an object with the "id" as the key 
  and the actual ID value as the value. The method looks at the object and uses the "id" to find
  the exact item to remove. Using an object makes your code more flexible. If later on, you need to delete
  based on multiple criteria like "id" and "userId" you can just add more properties to the object .delete({id, userId}) */
